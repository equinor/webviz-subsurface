## [Unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD
### Added
- [#417](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/417) - Added an optional argument `--testdata-folder` to `pytest`, can be used when [test data](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata) is in non-default location.
- [#422](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/422) - `HistoryMatch` plugin now
quietly excludes all realizations lacking an `OK` file written by `ERT` on completion of realization workflow, similar to behavior of other plugins that read from individual realizations. Previously wrote warnings for missing data.
- [#428](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/428) - Plugin controls, such as dropdown selections, set by the user is kept on page reload.
- [#435](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/435) - Suppress a warning in SurfaceViewerFMU when calculating statistics from surfaces where one or more surface only has NaN values. [#399](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/399)
- [#438](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/438) - Improved documentation of generation of data input for `RelativePermability` plugin.

### Fixed
- [#432](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/432) - Bug fix in ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries. Vectors starting with A, V, G, I, N, T, V and L resulted in crash due to a bug introduced in [#373](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/373) (most notably group and aquifer vectors).
- [#442](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/442) - Bug fix in ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries. Wrong realization number was shown if data set contained missing realizations. Now uses correct realization number from data.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-08-24
### Changed
- [#415](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/415) - Now using `xml` package from standard Python library (together with [`defusexml`](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/)) instead of [`bs4`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).
