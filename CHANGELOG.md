## [0.1.8] - 2021-01-26
### Changed
- [#538](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/issues/538) - Refactored code for reading Eclipse INIT files and added framework for units and unit conversions.
- [#544](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/544) - All plugins now use new special `webviz_settings` argument to plugin's `__init__` method for common settings in favor of piggybacking dictionary onto the to the Dash applicaton object.
- [#541](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/541) - Implemented new onepass shader for all surface plugins.

### Fixed
- [#536](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/536) - Fixed issue and bumped dependencies related to Pandas version 1.2.0. Bumped dependency to webviz-config to support mypy typechecks.

## [0.1.7] - 2020-12-19
### Fixed
- [#526](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/526) - Fixes to `SurfaceViewerFMU`. User defined map units are now correctly displayed. Map height can now be set (useful for maps with elongated geometry). Added some missing documentation
- [#531](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/531) - The change in [#505](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/505) resulted in potentially very large datasets when using `raw` sampling. Some users experienced `MemoryError`. `column_keys` filtering is therefore now used when loading and storing data if `sampling` is `raw` in plugins using `UNSMRY` data, most noticable in `BhpQc` which has `raw` as the default and only option.

### Added
- [#529](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/529) - Added support for PVDO and PVTG to PVT plot and to respective data modules.
- [#509](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/509) - Added descriptive hoverinfo to  `ParameterAnalysis`. Average and standard deviation of parameter value
for each ensemble shown on mouse hover over figure. Included dynamic sizing of plot titles and plot spacing to optimize the appearance of plots when many parameters are plotted.

## [0.1.6] - 2020-11-30
### Fixed
- [#505](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/505) - Fixed recent performance regression issue for loading of UNSMRY data. Loading times when multiple plugins are using the same data is now significantly reduced. Note that all UNSMRY vectors are now stored in portable apps, independent of choice of column_keys in individual plugins.

## [0.1.5] - 2020-11-26
### Added
- [#478](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/478) - New plugin `AssistedHistoryMatchingAnalysis`. This dashboard helps to analyze the update step performed during assisted history match. E.g. which observations are causing an update in a specific parameter. Based on Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov.
- [#494](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/494) - New plugin `ParameterAnalysis`. Dashboard to visualize parameter distributions and statistics for FMU ensembles, and to investigate parameter correlations on reservoir simulation time series data.

### Fixed
- [#486](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/486) - Bug fix in `PropertyStatistics`. Show realization number instead of dataframe index for hover text.
- [#498](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/498) - Bug fix in `RFT-plotter`. Sort dataframe by date to get correct order in date-slider.

## [0.1.4] - 2020-10-29
### Added
- [#457](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/457) - Raise a descriptive error if a scratch ensemble is empty, i.e. no `OK` target file is found in any realizations.
- [#427](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/427) - `BhpQc` plugin added: Quality check that simulated bottom hole pressures are realistic.
- [#481](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/481) - `RFT-plotter`: Added support for MD, and made ECLIPSE RFT data optional.
- [#467](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/467) - `PropertyStatistics` plugin added: QC and analysis of grid property statistics.

### Fixed
- [#450](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/450) - Flipped colormap for subsurface maps (such that deeper areas get darker colors). Also fixed hill shading such that input values are treated as depth, not positive elevation.
- [#459](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/459) - Bug fix in ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries. All `History` traces are now toggled when clicking `History` in the legend.
- [#474](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/474) - Bug fix in ParameterCorrelation. Constant parameters are now removed if `drop_constants` is set to `True`
- [#480](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/480) - Bug fix in SubsurfaceMap, InplaceVolumes and InplaceVolumesOneByOne: Filter on `OK` file is now applied when loading data from ensembles through fmu-ensemble.
- [#482](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/482) - Bug fix in ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries: NaN values are now dropped instead of being replaced by zeros, e.g. if some realizations are missing in one of the ensembles, if the dates don't match, or if a vector is missing in one of the ensembles.

## [0.1.3] - 2020-09-24
### Added
- [#417](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/417) - Added an optional argument `--testdata-folder` to `pytest`, can be used when [test data](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata) is in non-default location.
- [#422](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/422) - `HistoryMatch` plugin now
quietly excludes all realizations lacking an `OK` file written by `ERT` on completion of realization workflow, similar to behavior of other plugins that read from individual realizations. Previously wrote warnings for missing data.
- [#428](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/428) - Plugin controls, such as dropdown selections, set by the user is kept on page reload.
- [#435](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/435) - Suppress a warning in SurfaceViewerFMU when calculating statistics from surfaces where one or more surface only has NaN values. [#399](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/399)
- [#438](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/438) - Improved documentation of generation of data input for `RelativePermability` plugin.
- [#434](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/434) - Improved hillshading and colors in plugins with map views.
- [#439](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/439) - Pie chart and bar chart are now visualized together in `DiskUsage`. Free space is now visualized as well.

### Fixed
- [#432](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/432) - Bug fix in ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries. Vectors starting with A, V, G, I, N, T, V and L resulted in crash due to a bug introduced in [#373](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/373) (most notably group and aquifer vectors).
- [#442](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/442) - Bug fix in ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries. Wrong realization number was shown if data set contained missing realizations. Now uses correct realization number from data.
- [#447](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/447) - Changed two `webvizstore` decorated functions such that they do not take in `pandas` objects as arguments, which are known to not have `repr()` useful for hashing.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-08-24
### Changed
- [#415](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/415) - Now using `xml` package from standard Python library (together with [`defusexml`](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/)) instead of [`bs4`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).
