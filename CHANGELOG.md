### Added
- [#783](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/783) - `VolumetricAnalysis` - added tab with Fipfile QC for inspection of which `FIPNUM's` and `REGIONâˆ•ZONE's` that have been combined in order to get comparable volumes between dynamic and static sources. This tab is only available if a fipfile is given as input.
- [#777](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/777) - `VolumetricAnalysis` - added tabs with `Source comparison` and `Ensemble comparison` as QC tools for quick identification of where and why volumetric changes occur across sources (e.g. static vs dynamic) or ensembles (e.g. model revisions or ahm iterations).

### Added
- [#478](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/478) - New plugin `AssistedHistoryMatchingAnalysis`.

- [#459](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/459) - Bug fix in ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries. All `History` traces are now toggled when clicking `History` in the legend.
- [#474](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/474) - Bug fix in ParameterCorrelation. Constant parameters are now removed if `drop_constants` is set to `True`

### Added
- [#417](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/417) - Added an optional argument `--testdata-folder` to `pytest`, can be used when [test data](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata) is in non-default location.

- [#442](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/442) - Bug fix in ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries. Wrong realization number was shown if data set contained missing realizations. Now uses correct realization number from data.
- [#447](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/447) - Changed two `webvizstore` decorated functions such that they do not take in `pandas` objects as arguments, which are known to not have `repr()` useful for hashing.

### Changed
- [#415](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface/pull/415) - Now using `xml` package from standard Python library (together with [`defusexml`](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/)) instead of [`bs4`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).
