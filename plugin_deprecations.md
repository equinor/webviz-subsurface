How to use in YAML config file:
```yaml
    - ReservoirSimulationTimeSeries:
        csvfile:  # Optional, type str (corresponding to a path).
        ensembles:  # Optional, type list.
        obsfile:  # Optional, type str (corresponding to a path).
        column_keys:  # Optional, type list.
        sampling:  # Optional, type str.
        options:  # Optional, type dict.
        predefined_expressions:  # Optional, type str.
        line_shape_fallback:  # Optional, type str.
```



<!-- tab:Data input -->


?> Vectors that are identified as historical vectors (e.g. FOPTH is the history of FOPT) will be plotted together with their non-historical counterparts as reference lines, and they are therefore not selectable as vectors to plot initially.

?> The `obsfile` is a common (optional) file for all ensembles, which can be converted from e.g. ERT and ResInsight formats using the [fmuobs](https://equinor.github.io/subscript/scripts/fmuobs.html) script. [An example of the format can be found here](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata/blob/master/reek_history_match/share/observations/observations.yml).

!> It is **strongly recommended** to keep the data frequency to a regular frequency (like `monthly` or `yearly`). This applies to both csv input and when reading from `UNSMRY` (controlled by the `sampling` key). This is because the statistics and fancharts are calculated per DATE over all realizations in an ensemble, and the available dates should therefore not differ between individual realizations of an ensemble.

**Using aggregated data**

The `csvfile` must have columns `ENSEMBLE`, `REAL` and `DATE` in addition to the individual
vectors.
* [Example of aggregated file](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata/blob/master/aggregated_data/smry.csv).

**Using simulation time series data directly from `.UNSMRY` files**

Vectors are extracted automatically from the `UNSMRY` files in the individual realizations,
using the `fmu-ensemble` library.

?> Using the `UNSMRY` method will also extract metadata like units, and whether the vector is a rate, a cumulative, or historical. Units are e.g. added to the plot titles, while rates and cumulatives are used to decide the line shapes in the plot. Aggregated data may on the other speed up the build of the app, as processing of `UNSMRY` files can be slow for large models. Using this method is required to use the average rate and interval cumulative functionalities, as they require identification of vectors that are cumulatives.

!> The `UNSMRY` files are auto-detected by `fmu-ensemble` in the `eclipse/model` folder of the individual realizations. You should therefore not have more than one `UNSMRY` file in this folder, to avoid risk of not extracting the right data.

#### SurfaceViewerFMU

<details>
  <summary markdown="span"> :warning: Plugin 'SurfaceViewerFMU' has been deprecated.</summary>

  Relevant functionality is implemented in the MapViewerFMU plugin.
</details>


<!-- tabs:start -->


<!-- tab:Description -->

Covisualize surfaces from an ensemble.

There are 3 separate map views. 2 views can be set independently, while
the 3rd view displays the resulting map by combining the other maps, e.g.
by taking the difference or summing the values.

There is flexibility in which combinations of surfaces that are displayed
and calculated, such that surfaces can be compared across ensembles and realizations.

Statistical calculations across the ensemble(s) are
done on the fly. If the ensemble(s) or surfaces have a large size, it is recommended
to run webviz in `portable` mode so that the statistical surfaces are pre-calculated,
and available for instant viewing.




<!-- tab:Arguments -->

















* **`ensembles`:** Which ensembles in `shared_settings` to visualize.
* **`attributes`:** List of surface attributes to include, if not given
    all surface attributes will be included.
* **`attribute_settings`:** Dictionary with setting for each attribute.
    Available settings are:
    * `min`: Truncate colorscale (lower limit).
    * `max`: Truncate colorscale (upper limit).
    * `color`: List of hexadecimal colors.
    * `unit`: Text to display as unit in label.
* **`wellfolder`:** Folder with RMS wells.
* **`wellsuffix`:** File suffix for wells in well folder.
* **`map_height`:** Set the height in pixels for the map views.



---
How to use in YAML config file:
```yaml
    - SurfaceViewerFMU:
        ensembles:  # Required, type list.
        attributes:  # Optional, type list.
        attribute_settings:  # Optional, type dict.
        wellfolder:  # Optional, type str (corresponding to a path).
        wellsuffix:  # Optional, type str.
        map_height:  # Optional, type int.
```



<!-- tab:Data input -->

The available maps are gathered from the `share/results/maps/` folder
for each realization. Subfolders are not supported.

The filenames need to follow a fairly strict convention, as the filenames are used as metadata:
`horizon_name--attribute--date` (`--date` is optional). The files should be on `irap binary`
format with the suffix `.gri`. The date is of the form `YYYYMMDD` or
`YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD`, the latter would be for a delta surface between two dates.
See [this folder](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata/tree/master/reek_history_match/realization-0/iter-0/share/results/maps) for examples of file naming conventions.

The `attribute_settings` consists of optional settings for the individual attributes that are
extracted based on the filenames mentioned above. For attributes called `atr_a` and `atr_b`, the
configuration of `attribute_settings` could e.g. be:
```yaml
attribute_settings:
  atr_a:
    min: 4
    max: 10
    unit: m
  atr_b:
    color:
    - "#000004"
    - "#1b0c41"
    - "#4a0c6b"
    - "#781c6d"

#### WellCompletions

<details>
  <summary markdown="span"> :warning: Plugin 'WellCompletions' has been deprecated.</summary>

  This plugin has been replaced by the `WellCompletion` plugin (without the `s`) which is based on the `wellcompletionsdata` export from `ecl2df`. The new plugin is faster and has more functionality.

How to use in YAML config file:
```yaml
    - WellCompletions:
        ensembles:  # Required, type list.
        compdat_file:  # Optional, type str.
        well_connection_status_file:  # Optional, type str.

        kh_decimal_places:  # Optional, type int.
```



<!-- tab:Data input -->

The minimum requirement is to define `ensembles`.

**COMPDAT input**

`compdat_file` is a path to a file stored per realization (e.g. in     `share/results/tables/compdat.csv`). This file can be exported to disk per realization by using
the `ECL2CSV` forward model in ERT with subcommand `compdat`. [Link to ecl2csv compdat documentation.](https://equinor.github.io/ecl2df/usage/compdat.html)

The connection status history of each cell is not necessarily complete in the `ecl2df` export,
because status changes resulting from ACTIONs can't be extracted from the Eclipse input
files. If the `ecl2df` export is good, it is recommended to use that. This will often be the
case for history runs. But if not, an alternative way of extracting the data is described in
the next section.

**Well Connection status input**

The `well_connection_status_file` is a path to a file stored per realization (e.g. in     `share/results/tables/wellconnstatus.csv`. This file can be exported to disk per realization
by using the `ECL2CSV` forward model in ERT with subcommand `wellconnstatus`.  [Link to ecl2csv wellconnstatus documentation.](https://equinor.github.io/ecl2df/usage/wellconnstatus.html)

This approach uses the CPI summary data to create a well connection status history: for
each well connection cell there is one line for each time the connection is opened or closed.
This data is sparse, but be aware that the CPI summary data can potentially become very large.

**Zone layer mapping**

The `zone_layer_mapping_file` file can be dumped to disk per realization by an internal     RMS script as part of the FMU workflow. A sample python script should be available in the     Drogon project.

The file needs to be on the lyr format used by ResInsight:
[Link to description of lyr format](https://resinsight.org/3d-main-window/formations/#formation-names-description-files-_lyr_).

Zone colors can be specified in the lyr file, but only 6 digit hexadecimal codes will be used.

If no file exists, layers will be used as zones.

**Stratigraphy file**

The `stratigraphy_file` file is intended to be generated per realization by an internal     RMS script as part of the FMU workflow, but can also be set up manually and copied to each
realization. The stratigraphy is a tree structure, where each node has a name, an optional
`color` parameter, and an optional `subzones` parameter which itself is a list of the same format.
```json
[
    {
        "name": "ZoneA",
        "color": "#FFFFFF",
        "subzones": [
            {
                "name": "ZoneA.1"
            },
            {
                "name": "ZoneA.2"
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "ZoneB",
        "color": "#FFF000",
        "subzones": [
            {
                "name": "ZoneB.1",
                "color": "#FFF111"
            },
            {
                "name": "ZoneB.2",
                "subzones: {"name": "ZoneB.2.2"}
            }
        ]
    },
]
```
The `stratigraphy_file` and the `zone_layer_mapping_file` will be combined to create the final     stratigraphy. A node will be removed if the name or any of the subnode names are not     present in the zone layer mapping. A Value Error is raised if any zones are present in the
zone layer mapping but not in the stratigraphy.

Colors can be supplied both trough the stratigraphy and through the zone_layer_mapping.     The following prioritization will be applied:
1. Colors specified in the stratigraphy
2. Colors specified in the zone layer mapping lyr file
3. If none of the above is specified, theme colors will be added to the leaves of the tree

**Well Attributes file**

The `well_attributes_file` file is intended to be generated per realization by an internal     RMS script as part of the FMU workflow. A sample script will be made available, but it is     possible to manually set up the file and copy it to the correct folder on the scratch disk.    The categorical well attributes are completely flexible.

The file should be a `.json` file on the following format:
```json
{
    "version" : "0.1",
    "wells" : [
        {
            "alias" : {
                "eclipse" : "OP_1"
            },
            "attributes" : {
                "mlt_singlebranch" : "mlt",
                "structure" : "East",
                "welltype" : "producer"
            },
            "name" : "OP_1"
        },
        {
            "alias" : {
                "eclipse" : "GI_1"
            },
            "attributes" : {
                "mlt_singlebranch" : "singlebranch",
                "structure" : "West",
                "welltype" : "gas injector"
            },
            "name" : "GI_1"
        },
    ]
}
```

**KH unit**

If defaulted, the plugin will look for the unit system of the Eclipse deck in the DATA file.     The kh unit will be deduced from the unit system, e.g. mDÂ·m if METRIC.

* **`wellfiles`:** List of file paths to RMS wells (absolute or relative to config file).
* **`wellfolder`:** Alternative to `wellfiles`: provide a folder with RMS wells. (absolute or relative to config file).
* **`wellsuffix`:** File suffix for wells in `wellfolder`.
* **`segyfiles`:** List of file paths to `segyfiles` (absolute or relative to config file).
* **`zunit`:** z-unit for display.
* **`zonelog`:** Name of zonelog in `wellfiles` (displayed along well trajectory).
* **`marginal_logs`:** Logs in `wellfiles` to be displayed in separate horizontal plot.
* **`zmin`:** Visualized minimum z-value in cross section.
* **`zmax`:** Visualized maximum z-value in cross section.
* **`zonemin`:** First zonenumber to draw in zone log.
* **`sampling`:** Horizontal sampling interval.
* **`nextend`:** Number of samples to extend well fence on each side of well, e.g. `sampling=20` and `nextend=2` results in `extension=20*2`. * **`colors`:** List of hex colors corresponding to surfaces. Note that apostrophies     should be used to avoid that hex colors are read as comments. E.g. `'#000000'` for black.

**Example files**

* [Segyfiles](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata/tree/master/observed_data/seismic).

* [One file for surfacefiles](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata/blob/master/reek_history_match/realization-0/iter-0/share/results/maps/topupperreek--ds_extracted_horizons.gri).

* [Wellfiles](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-testdata/tree/master/observed_data/wells).

The segyfiles are on a `SEG-Y` format and can be investigated outside `webviz` using e.g. [xtgeo](https://xtgeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The surfacefiles are on a `ROFF binary` format and can be investigated outside `webviz` using e.g. [xtgeo](https://xtgeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
